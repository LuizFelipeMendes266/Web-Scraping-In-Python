## Project Description

In this project, we have a script that performs web scraping of a real estate website called Brasil Brokers, properly separating the information.

## Methodology

The scrapy library was used, where a class and its respective functions were created to perform capture, pagination, and structuring of information through the ItemLoader. The paths for each piece of information were properly described by their HTML path.

## Results

As a result, we obtained all the main information that each advertisement on the website offers, including multiple cities and regions.

## Notes

- A library called "items" was built for the joint capture of xpaths for each HTML path for each advertisement.
- The Regex library was used to correctly filter the information.
